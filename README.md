# Minimalistic Electron React Boilerplate Code


This is a minimal Electron React boilerplate code using webpack and webpack-loader. It's simple and you can built upon starter code. I know there are tons of boilerplate code out there but either they are too tricky for beginner or just a pain. I wanted to code my app not stuck in configuring for a year. Feel free to improve by commiting changes

**After making changes to renderer.js hit Ctrl+R in app window to reload manually**
There is no hot reloading. This is a minimal boilerplate code that will just get you started.

`**IMPORTANT** Everytime you change something (in any js file) you have to change something in render.js( type something then comment it out) and hit Ctrl+ R to recompile everything `
